      <h2>Building Strong Passwords</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Length Matters:</strong><br>
          Aim for passwords that are at least 12 to 16 characters long. Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mix Character Types:</strong><br>
          Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This mix increases the complexity of your password.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use Passphrases:</strong><br>
          Consider using a series of unrelated words or a sentence that is easy for you to remember but difficult for others to guess. For example, "Blue!Tree7Rainy#Sky" is stronger than a single word.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid Common Words and Patterns:</strong><br>
          Do not use easily guessable words, common phrases, or predictable sequences like "12345" or "password." Even substituting letters (like "P@ssw0rd") can be risky if the underlying pattern is obvious.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Uniqueness Is Key:</strong><br>
          Use a unique password for each account. This way, if one account is compromised, your other accounts remain secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consider a Password Manager:</strong><br>
          A reputable password manager can generate complex passwords and securely store them so you don’t have to remember each one.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Information:</strong><br>
          Avoid using easily obtainable data such as your name, birthday, pet’s name, or simple variations of these details.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reusing Passwords:</strong><br>
          Don’t use the same password across multiple accounts. Reusing passwords means that a breach on one service can put all your accounts at risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Obvious Patterns or Sequences:</strong><br>
          Steer clear of sequential numbers (like 1234) or patterns (like qwerty) that hackers can quickly try.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Outdated or Common Substitutions:</strong><br>
          Many people believe that replacing "a" with "@" or "s" with "$" makes a password secure. However, these substitutions are well-known to attackers and should not be your only line of defense.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Storing Passwords Insecurely:</strong><br>
          Avoid writing passwords down on paper or saving them in unsecured digital files. Use encrypted storage or a trusted password manager instead.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional Security Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong><br>
          Whenever possible, add an extra layer of security by enabling MFA. This means even if someone obtains your password, they’ll still need another form of verification to access your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong><br>
          Regularly update your operating system, browser, and any security software. Updates often include patches for vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Be Cautious with Phishing Attempts:</strong><br>
          Always verify the authenticity of emails or messages asking for login information. When in doubt, navigate directly to the official website rather than clicking on links.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitor Your Accounts:</strong><br>
          Set up alerts where possible, so you’re notified of any suspicious activity or login attempts. This proactive approach can help you respond quickly if something seems off.
